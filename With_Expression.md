# With Expression
The **with** expression:

Defines a local scope for variables if you need a couple of temporary variables to calculate something:

[with expression scope](./with_expression_scope.exs)

Gives some control over pattern matching when using the **<-** operator:

[with expression pattern matching](./with_expression_patterm_match.exs)

NOTE: if a match fails it will return the value that could not be matched
